  <h1>Privacy Policy for MicroMacroTracker</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 02 January 2026</p>

  <p>MicroMacroTracker is provided by <strong>Martin Fabian</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles personal data and device permissions.</p>
  <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Data controller and contact</h2>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Martin Fabian<br>
     <strong>Email:</strong> micromacronutrilabs@gmail.com</p>
  <p>If you have any questions or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at the email address above.</p>

  <h2>2. Data we collect and how we use it</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Data you enter in the App</h3>
  <p>The App allows you to enter and manage nutrition‑related information, including for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Foods, meals and nutrient values</li>
    <li>Personal preferences and app settings (e.g. units, theme)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used solely to provide the core functionality of the App (nutrition and tracking features) and to improve your user experience.</p>

  <h3>2.2 Device permissions: Camera</h3>
  <p>The App may request access to:</p>
  <p><strong>Camera (android.permission.CAMERA):</strong> Used to scan barcodes and/or capture images in order to make it easier to add foods or related items. The camera feed is used only for this purpose. Images are not uploaded to our servers because we do not operate any server for this App.</p>
  <p>You can deny this permission; in that case, the corresponding features (e.g. barcode scanning) may not work, but you can continue to use other parts of the App.</p>

  <h2>3. Offline‑only data processing</h2>
  <p>The App is designed to work <strong>offline</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> operate any backend server for this App.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> transmit or store your nutrition data, camera images or other personal data on our own servers.</li>
    <li>All data you enter or that is generated by the App is stored locally on your device’s storage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your device uses its own backups (e.g. Google backup), your data may be included in such system‑level backups according to your device/account settings. [web:149][web:155]</p>

  <h2>4. Third‑party services</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> use third‑party analytics, advertising SDKs or external crash reporting services that collect personal data. We do not sell, rent or otherwise share your personal data with third parties. [web:151][web:158]</p>

  <h2>5. Legal basis and your rights (EU/EEA users)</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the European Union or European Economic Area, the processing of your data is primarily based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contractual necessity:</strong> We process data you enter in the App to provide you with the App’s core functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For permissions such as camera, which you can allow or deny in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because data is stored locally on your device and not on our servers, you generally control it directly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can edit or delete entries within the App.</li>
    <li>You can delete all App data by uninstalling the App or clearing its data in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you contact us, you may also exercise rights such as access, correction or deletion of any data you voluntarily provide to us (e.g. via email). [web:138]</p>

  <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
  <p>We do not retain your in‑app data on our own systems.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data stored in the App remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.</li>
    <li>If you contact us by email, we may keep that correspondence for as long as necessary to handle your request and for legitimate business or legal purposes. [web:152]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under the age requiring parental consent for data processing in your jurisdiction (for example, under 16 in the EU). We do not knowingly collect personal data from such children. If you believe we have unintentionally collected data from a child, please contact us so that we can delete the information. [web:144]</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>Because all in‑app data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data also depends on how you protect your device (e.g. screen lock, OS updates). We recommend that you use a secure device password or biometric lock and keep your operating system up to date. [web:153]</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. The latest version will always be available at this URL and will show the date of the last update at the top. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy. [web:147]</p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, concerns or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, you can contact:</p>
